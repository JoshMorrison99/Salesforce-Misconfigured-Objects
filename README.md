# Salesforce-Misconfigured-Objects

Permissions are set for objects, fields and records separately. Out of the three, we as pen-testers really care about the record permissions because they are the real data.

#### Google Dork

```

#### Aura Paths
The applicaiton needs to use Salesforce programming technologies like Aura components for it to be vulnerable to "Improper Authorization". If one of the HTTP POST requests are visiable, then Â there is a possibility for an Improper Authorisation vulnerability.
```
/s/sfsites/aura  
/aura  
/sfsites/aura
```

Aura can be identified using the Google Dorks above or with this Nuclei template which checks for the Aura HTTP Paths above: https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/misconfiguration/salesforce-aura.yaml
